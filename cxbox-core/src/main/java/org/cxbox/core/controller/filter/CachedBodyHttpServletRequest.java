/**
 * A custom {@link HttpServletRequestWrapper} that caches the request body to allow multiple reads
 * of the {@link ServletInputStream}.
 *
 * <p>By default, {@link HttpServletRequest#getInputStream()} can only be read once. This wrapper
 * reads the entire request body during construction and stores it in memory, allowing the body
 * to be read multiple times without issues.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Logging request bodies for debugging or audit purposes</li>
 *   <li>Request validation or preprocessing before reaching controllers</li>
 *   <li>Custom argument resolvers that need to parse the request body</li>
 *   <li>Filters that need to inspect request content without consuming the stream</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Memory Considerations:</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The entire request body is stored in memory as a byte array</li>
 *   <li>Large request bodies may cause memory issues</li>
 *   <li>Consider implementing size limits for production use</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Usage Example:</strong></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Component
 * public class MultipleReadRequestFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {
 *     @Override
 *     protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request,
 *                                     HttpServletResponse response,
 *                                     FilterChain filterChain)
 *             throws ServletException, IOException {
